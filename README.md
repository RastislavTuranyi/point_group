# point_group

This is a project to create a Rust crate for working with point groups in chemical context.
It is currently under development, with the priorities being as follows:

1.  Finish writing tests for the `find_point_group` function which determines the point group of
a molecule from only its coordinates.
2.  Write structs representing various chemically important point groups
